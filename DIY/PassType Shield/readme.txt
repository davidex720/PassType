PassType Shield is a prototype and it was first released as a project here:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Password-Manager-Typer-Macro-Payload-All-in-ONE/

It is a dirty and cheap prototype and still in evolution, 
it is a parallel work with the coming soon improved and boosted commercial version.
