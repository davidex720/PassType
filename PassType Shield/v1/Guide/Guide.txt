Step by step guide


1. Solder the 24LC256 to the PassType Shield. Choose only one of the thow sockets (smd or arduino pin compatible package)

2. Solder the USB male connector if you have a PassType Shield without it already soldered on it

3. Solder the OLED module in position and trim away the pins on both sides

4. Solder the Arduino Pro Micro as flush as you can with the pcb using pins and trim them
  4.1 If you have an Arduino Pro Micro with J1 (see image) open solder the jumper close

5. Solder two small wires as in the picture, they will provide data output to the USB connector integrated on PassType Shield

6. Solder the 5-way switch (the mini joystick)

7. Plug the Arduino Pro Micro micro usb port on your computer and check you can programm it. Now feel free to develop your software
   use the one you find in this github repo! 



8. Enjoy!
